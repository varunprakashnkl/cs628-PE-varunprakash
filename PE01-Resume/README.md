# Input
Inputs can vary depending on the program's purpose. Examples include user-provided data via forms or command-line arguments, data read from files (e.g., CSV, JSON), or data received from external sources like APIs or databases. Clearly defining expected input formats and types is crucial for proper program execution. Incorrect or missing inputs can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

# Process
This involves the steps the program takes to transform the input data into meaningful output. These steps might include data validation, calculations, data manipulation (sorting, filtering, aggregation), logical operations (if/else statements, loops), and interactions with external systems. The process is the core logic of the program, and its efficiency and accuracy directly impact the final output.

# Output
Outputs can take various forms, including displaying information on the screen, writing data to files, sending data over a network, or triggering actions in other systems. The output should be presented in a clear, concise, and user-friendly format. The type and format of the output should align with the program's intended purpose and the user's expectations.
