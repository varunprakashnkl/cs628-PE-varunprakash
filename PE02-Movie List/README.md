# Movie List Application

The Movie List Application is a React-based project that displays a collection of movies with details such as title, genre, and release year. Users can interact with the application to filter movies by genre using a dropdown menu and view details about individual movies by clicking on them.

## Input

The application uses a predefined list of movies as its input. Each movie includes a title, genre, and release year. This data serves as the foundation for rendering the movie list and enabling filtering functionality.

## Output

The application displays a dynamic list of movies. Users can select a genre from a dropdown menu to filter the displayed movies or choose the "All Genres" option to view the entire list. Each movie is displayed in an organized format, and clicking on a movie displays an alert with its title.

## Outcome

This PE demonstrates the use of React functional components and hooks to create an interactive and user-friendly movie catalog. Users gain a seamless experience navigating the list of movies, filtering them by genre, and interacting with individual movie items. The application also showcases best practices in component-based design and state management in React.
